Being a transplant sports fan -- living in a city that doesn't represent the teams you root for -- can be pretty annoying when it comes to watching the teams you cheer for. Your teams are rarely shown on TV and unless you're streaming every single sport, it can be difficult to watch your teams. That's where the sports bar finder comes in. Type in where you are and you can find out about the top 20 rated sports bars in your area.
